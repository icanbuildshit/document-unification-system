# Document Unification System â€” Roadmap & Status

## âœ… Completed Features
- **Metadata scrubbing**: Configurable fields and modes via `MetadataAgent`.
- **Unit tests**: Coverage for scrubbing, enrichment, and validation.
- **CLI integration**: User-facing flags for scrubbing options.
- **Audit logging**: All metadata scrubbing events logged for compliance.
- **Debugging and error tracing**: Debug prints for pipeline tracing.
- **Supabase integration**: Storage agent expects Supabase credentials.
- **Specialized orchestration architecture**: Implemented modular orchestrator hierarchy.
- **Specialized orchestrators implementation**: Created placeholder implementations for all eight specialized orchestrators.
- **Standardized orchestrator communication protocol**: Implemented message schema for inter-orchestrator communication with request IDs, context propagation, and centralized logging.
- **Error handling and graceful fallback**: Improved pipeline robustness with fallback mechanisms for parsing, storage, and other orchestrator failures.

## ðŸš§ TODOs / Roadmap
- [x] **Implement specialized orchestrators**
  - âœ… Master Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Document Parser Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Metadata Management Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Storage Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Workflow Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Authentication Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Audit & Compliance Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Analytics Orchestrator implementation
  - âœ… Publication Orchestrator implementation
- [x] **Standardized orchestrator communication protocol**
  - âœ… Implement message schema for inter-orchestrator communication
  - âœ… Add request IDs and context propagation
  - âœ… Create centralized logging for orchestrator handoffs
- [x] **Error handling and graceful fallback**
  - âœ… Improve pipeline robustness, especially for storage and parsing failures
  - âœ… Implement fallback mechanisms for unavailable orchestrators
  - âœ… Add distributed tracing for error diagnosis
- [ ] **JWT-based authentication & Supabase Auth integration**
  - For multi-user, commercial, or SaaS use. (Deferred, see notes below)
- [ ] **User-facing documentation**
  - Update README and/or add a `docs/` folder with usage, config, and architecture details.
- [ ] **Config file support**
  - Allow users to specify options via a config file (YAML/JSON) as well as CLI.
- [ ] **Advanced audit/compliance hooks**
  - Support for external audit systems, more granular logging, or compliance exports.
- [ ] **Production-ready storage abstraction**
  - Allow swapping Supabase for other backends (local, S3, etc.) for flexibility.
- [ ] **User feedback and reporting**
  - CLI or web UI for users to see processing/audit results and errors.
- [ ] **Performance and scalability improvements**
  - Batch processing, async support, and resource monitoring.
- [ ] **(Optional) Web UI or API**
  - For non-CLI users or integration with other systems.

## ðŸ•’ Deferred / To Revisit
- **JWT-based authentication**: Required for commercial/multi-user use. See Supabase Auth docs and previous notes for implementation steps.
- **Distributed orchestrator deployment**: Architecture for deploying orchestrators across multiple machines for high availability.

## ðŸ“… Next Steps
1. âœ… Complete the standardized orchestrator communication protocol implementation
2. âœ… Enhance error handling and graceful fallback mechanisms across all orchestrators
3. Implement more comprehensive documentation for the specialized orchestration architecture
4. Test the orchestrator handoffs with integration tests
