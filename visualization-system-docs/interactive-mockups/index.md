# Interactive Mockups

This directory contains mockups demonstrating how the Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer would transform complex code into intuitive, interactive visualizations. These mockups show the visual appearance, user interface, and interactive capabilities of the system.

## Contents

### [Interactive Visualization Examples](./interactive_visualization_examples.md)

This document provides example visualizations of the Document Unification System:

- **System Overview Visualization** - How the high-level system architecture would appear
- **Document Processing Workflow Visualization** - The document journey visualized
- **Code Component View** - Detailed visualization of specific components
- **Interactive Animation** - Animated workflow walk-throughs
- **Model Selection Visualization** - The model selection process visualized
- **Authentication Flow Visualization** - Security processes made intuitive

Each example uses the metaphor-based approach (houses, people, toys, notes, plugs) to represent code elements in an intuitive way, with accompanying narrative explanations.

### [User Interface Mockups](./user_interface_mockups.md)

This document shows how the visualization system's user interface would work:

- **Main Interface Layout** - The primary user interface components
- **Main Visualization View** - How visualized code would appear
- **Component Detail View** - Detailed information on specific components
- **Workflow Animation View** - Interface for animated workflows
- **Code-to-Visualization View** - How actual code maps to visual elements
- **Customization Panel** - Options for tailoring the visualization
- **Sharing and Export Options** - How visualizations can be shared
- **Mobile View** - Responsive design for mobile devices
- **Documentation Integration** - Embedding in documentation systems

## Key Features Demonstrated

These mockups highlight several key features of the Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer:

1. **Intuitive Metaphors** - Complex code concepts represented as familiar objects
2. **Interactive Exploration** - Clicking and hovering to discover more information
3. **Animated Workflows** - Step-by-step animation of processes
4. **Narrative Explanations** - Simple, clear explanations of complex components
5. **Customizable Views** - Adjustable detail levels for different needs
6. **Integration Capabilities** - Embedding in documentation and development tools
7. **Responsive Design** - Adaptable to different device types
8. **Sharing Options** - Multiple ways to share and export visualizations

## Implementation Path

To move from these mockups to an actual implementation:

1. **Frontend Development** - Build the interactive visualization interface
2. **Code Analysis Engine** - Develop the system to analyze and map code
3. **Metaphor Mapping** - Implement the code-to-metaphor transformation
4. **Narrative Generation** - Create the explanation generation system
5. **Animation Engine** - Build the workflow animation capabilities
6. **Integration Components** - Develop embedding and sharing features

These mockups serve as a design target for the implementation phase of the Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer.
