## Conclusion

This evaluation framework provides a comprehensive approach to assessing the Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer across multiple dimensions. By establishing clear metrics, measurement methods, and success criteria, we can systematically evaluate the system's effectiveness in achieving its primary goal: making complex code understandable to users of all technical levels through an intuitive, narrative-driven visualization approach.

The evaluation plan balances quantitative metrics with qualitative assessment, recognizing that both objective measurements and subjective user experience are essential for a complete understanding of the system's value. By implementing this evaluation framework throughout the development process, we can ensure the visualization system delivers maximum value to all stakeholders while continuously improving based on evidence-based insights.
