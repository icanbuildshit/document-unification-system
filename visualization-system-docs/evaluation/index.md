# Evaluation Framework

This directory contains the comprehensive evaluation framework for the Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer system.

## Files

- [Evaluation Criteria](./visualization_system_evaluation_criteria.md) - Detailed framework for evaluating system effectiveness

## Evaluation Dimensions

The evaluation framework covers five key dimensions:

1. **Comprehension Effectiveness** - How well users understand code
2. **User Experience Quality** - Quality of interaction with the system
3. **Technical Implementation Quality** - Robustness and scalability
4. **Educational Effectiveness** - Value as a learning tool
5. **Business Value** - Practical value to organizations

## Measurement Methods

The framework includes multiple measurement approaches:

1. **Comprehension Assessment Test** - Standardized test measuring code understanding
2. **User Experience Survey** - Structured survey based on System Usability Scale
3. **Time-on-Task Measurements** - Structured tasks with time measurement
4. **Qualitative Assessment Guide** - Framework for semi-structured interviews
5. **Business Impact Tracking Form** - Template for documenting business outcomes

## Key Metrics

The framework defines several visualization-specific metrics:

1. **Visualization Accuracy Index** - Correctness of representation
2. **Metaphor Effectiveness Score** - How well metaphors represent code concepts
3. **Narrative Clarity Index** - Clarity of explanations
4. **Interaction Engagement Score** - Level of user engagement
5. **Cross-Role Comprehension Delta** - Understanding across different roles

## Evaluation Implementation Plan

The framework includes a phased evaluation approach:

1. **Baseline Establishment** - Pre-implementation metrics collection
2. **Incremental Evaluation** - Assessment of specific features
3. **Comprehensive Assessment** - Multi-dimensional evaluation
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Ongoing feedback integration
