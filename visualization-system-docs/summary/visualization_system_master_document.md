# Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer - Master Document

This master document serves as the definitive reference for the Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer, bringing together all aspects of the system design, implementation, usage, and evaluation. This document connects and summarizes the complete set of artifacts produced through the visualization system process modeling effort.

## Overview and Purpose

The Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer transforms complex code into accessible, interactive "ELI5" (Explain Like I'm 5) visualizations that can be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences. Using a metaphor-based approach that represents code elements as houses, people, toys, notes, and plugs, the system creates intuitive visualizations with accompanying narratives to make code comprehension accessible to everyone.
