## Security Wing Entrance

The entrance to the Security Wing is a fortified gateway with reinforced doors and security scanners. Guards check credentials before allowing entry. A large security protocol poster details the authentication flow and security principles.

*Memory hook: The fortified entrance reminds you that `src/auth/` contains the security components that protect the entire system.*

The walls are adorned with security certificates and compliance badges, demonstrating adherence to security standards.

## Main Security Checkpoint

The central hub of the security wing with multiple security stations and monitoring screens. Security personnel monitor all system access and manage security operations.

*Memory hook: The central checkpoint reminds you that authentication is a centralized service in the system.*

## ID Verification Bureau

A dedicated section for validating user identities and issuing secure credentials.

### JWT Token Forge

A high-security facility where JWT tokens are crafted with specialized equipment. The tokens contain embedded identity information, expiration timestamps, and cryptographic signatures.

*Memory hook: The token forge reminds you of token creation in `src/auth/jwt_manager.py`.*

### Token Validation Laboratory

A verification facility where tokens are carefully examined to ensure authenticity. Specialized equipment checks signatures, expiration dates, and token integrity.

*Memory hook: The validation equipment reminds you of token verification in `src/auth/jwt_manager.py`.*

### Secret Vault

A highly secure vault where cryptographic keys and secrets are stored. Access requires multiple authorization levels and biometric verification.

*Memory hook: The secure vault reminds you of secret management for JWT operations.*

## Permissions Management Office

An administrative office managing authorization rules and access controls.

### Role Definition Library

A library containing detailed descriptions of all system roles. Each role is documented with its responsibilities and access rights.

*Memory hook: The role documentation reminds you of role definitions in `src/auth/permissions.py`.*

### Access Control Matrix Room

A room with a large matrix display showing which roles can access which resources. Security administrators configure access patterns here.

*Memory hook: The access matrix reminds you of permission checking in `src/auth/permissions.py`.*

### Authorization Engine

A control room where authorization decisions are made based on user identity and requested actions. The engine applies role-based rules to grant or deny access.

*Memory hook: The decision engine reminds you of the authorization logic in the permissions system.*

## Audit Chamber

A secure facility where all security-related events are recorded and monitored.

### Event Logging Station

A facility with continuous-feed printers and digital recorders capturing every security event. Each authentication, authorization, and security action is timestamped and recorded.

*Memory hook: The logging equipment reminds you of security event logging in `src/auth/audit.py`.*

### Security Monitoring Center

A monitoring room with dashboards showing security metrics, unusual activity alerts, and system health. Security analysts monitor for potential threats.

*Memory hook: The monitoring dashboards remind you of security monitoring capabilities.*

### Compliance Archive

A long-term storage facility where audit records are preserved for compliance purposes. Records are organized chronologically with tamper-evident seals.

*Memory hook: The compliance archive reminds you of audit record retention in the authentication system.*

## Middleware Gateway Hub

A technical facility managing the integration of security services with application requests.

### Request Interception Station

An interception facility where incoming requests are captured and examined before processing. Each request is inspected for security credentials.

*Memory hook: The interception station reminds you of request handling in `src/auth/middleware.py`.*

### Authentication Filter Bank

A series of security filters that incoming requests must pass through. Each filter checks a specific security aspect before allowing the request to proceed.

*Memory hook: The filter bank reminds you of authentication middleware filters.*

### Request Transformation Lab

A technical laboratory where requests are modified to include security context after successful authentication. Technicians add user identity and permission data to requests.

*Memory hook: The transformation lab reminds you of request enrichment in the middleware.*

## Client Connection Services

A specialized facility managing connections to external authentication services.

### Supabase Connection Terminal

A communication center with direct links to Supabase authentication services. Operators manage the connection and synchronize identity information.

*Memory hook: The Supabase terminal reminds you of `src/auth/supabase_client.py`.*

## Security Components Relationship

The security system components work together as a cohesive unit:

| Component | Relationship | Visualization |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| JWT Manager | Creates and validates tokens | Token forge creating secure passes |
| Permissions | Checks access rights | Guards checking access lists |
| Middleware | Intercepts requests | Security checkpoint screening visitors |
| Audit | Records all security events | Scribes recording all security activities |
| Supabase Client | Connects to external auth | Ambassador to external security alliance |

## How to Use This Memory Palace Room

When recalling the authentication system:

1. **Enter the security wing** - Remember the overall security architecture
2. **Visit the ID verification bureau** - Recall JWT token management
3. **Explore the permissions office** - Visualize authorization controls
4. **Tour the audit chamber** - Remember security logging
5. **Examine the middleware hub** - Recall request processing
6. **Check the client services** - Remember external integrations

Each location contains visual hooks that remind you of specific code files and their functions within the security system.
