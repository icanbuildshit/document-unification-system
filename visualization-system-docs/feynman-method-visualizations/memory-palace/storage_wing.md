## Storage Wing Entrance

As you enter the Storage Wing, you're greeted by a grand foyer with different archways leading to specialized storage areas. A large mosaic on the floor depicts the Storage Interface blueprint - the fundamental design that all storage implementations follow.

*Memory hook: The mosaic blueprint reminds you that `src/storage/storage_interface.py` defines the core interface all storage providers implement.*

Information kiosks provide details about different storage options, their characteristics, and appropriate use cases.

## Storage Administration

To your right is an administrative office overseeing all storage operations.

### Provider Factory Room

A control room with a switchboard allowing operators to select and configure different storage providers based on requirements. A large decision tree diagram shows the selection logic.

*Memory hook: The provider selection switchboard reminds you of `src/storage/storage_provider_factory.py` which creates appropriate storage provider instances.*

### Configuration Management

An office with filing cabinets containing configuration profiles for different storage providers. Staff here ensure each provider has the correct settings for optimal operation.

*Memory hook: The configuration profiles remind you of the storage configuration settings used across providers.*

## Interface Design Studio

To your left is a design studio where the fundamental storage interfaces are created and refined.

### Base Interface Blueprint Room

A drafting room with large technical drawings showing the base storage interface. The blueprints detail methods for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting information.

*Memory hook: The technical drawings remind you of the method signatures in `src/storage/storage_interface.py`.*

### Storage Contract Design

A legal office where contracts between the system and storage providers are drafted. Each contract specifies exactly what capabilities a provider must implement.

*Memory hook: The legal contracts remind you of the interface contract that all storage providers must fulfill.*

## Storage Provider Wing

Ahead of you extends a hallway with different storage vaults, each implementing a specific provider.

### Supabase Vault

A modern digital vault with Supabase branding. Inside, information is organized in a structured database format with quick retrieval systems.

*Memory hook: The Supabase-branded vault reminds you of `src/storage/supabase_storage.py`.*

### S3 Warehouse

A massive warehouse with Amazon S3 branding, containing countless storage containers organized by bucket. Robotic systems fetch and store objects efficiently.

*Memory hook: The S3-branded warehouse reminds you of `src/storage/s3_storage.py`.*

### Local Archive

A traditional archive room with filing cabinets and storage boxes. Staff here manage physical storage of documents within the local system.

*Memory hook: The traditional archive reminds you of `src/storage/local_storage.py`.*

## Enhanced Storage Facility

A separate wing with advanced storage technologies offering extended capabilities.

### Optimized Storage Laboratory

A high-tech laboratory where storage operations are analyzed and optimized for maximum performance. Engineers use specialized tools to measure and enhance speed, reliability, and efficiency.

*Memory hook: The optimization laboratory reminds you of `src/storage/supabase_storage_optimized.py`.*

### Extended Capabilities Center

A research facility developing enhanced storage features beyond the basic interface. Prototype systems demonstrate advanced querying, indexing, and specialized document handling.

*Memory hook: The extended capabilities remind you of `src/storage/enhanced_storage_interface.py`.*

## Storage Provider Comparison

The different storage providers are represented in the wing as different storage rooms with unique characteristics:

| Room Feature | Provider | Key Characteristics | Code File |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Supabase Vault | Supabase | Structured tables, real-time updates, authentication integration | src/storage/supabase_storage.py |
| S3 Warehouse | AWS S3 | Object storage, high durability, scalable capacity | src/storage/s3_storage.py |
| Local Archive | Local | File system storage, direct access, development simplicity | src/storage/local_storage.py |
| Optimized Room | Enhanced Supabase | Performance optimizations, caching, batch operations | src/storage/supabase_storage_optimized.py |

## How to Use This Memory Palace Room

When recalling the storage system:

1. **Enter the main foyer** - Remember the core storage interface
2. **Visit the administration office** - Recall the factory and configuration
3. **Tour the design studio** - Visualize the interface contracts
4. **Explore the provider vaults** - Remember specific storage implementations
5. **Check the enhanced facility** - Recall optimizations and extensions

Each location contains visual hooks that remind you of specific code files and their functions within the storage system.
