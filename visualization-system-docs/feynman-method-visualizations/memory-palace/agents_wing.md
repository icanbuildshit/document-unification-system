## Main Entrance Hall

As you first enter the Agents Wing, you notice a grand entrance hall with a large directory board showing all the agents in the system. The flooring is made of polished stone with the BaseAgent emblem embedded in it - this reminds you that **all agents inherit from BaseAgent**.

*Memory hook: The foundation stone with BaseAgent emblem reminds you that `src/agents/base_agent.py` is the foundation class for all agents.*

On the walls are portraits of various agents in action, with nameplates describing their specialties. A large banner reads "Serving the Document Unification Process with Specialized Skills."

## Agent Training Center

### Base Agent Facility

The first room on your left is a basic training facility with simple equipment. New agent recruits practice fundamental skills here:

- **Logging Station**: Agents learn to maintain detailed logs of their activities
- **Communication Basics**: Simple message handling and responses
- **Basic State Board**: A simple whiteboard tracking agent state

*Memory hook: The simple equipment reminds you that BaseAgent has only basic capabilities like logging, simple communication, and minimal state.*

### Enhanced Agent Academy

Proceeding further, you enter a more advanced facility with sophisticated training equipment:

- **Lifecycle Track**: A circular track where agents practice the initialize → process → finalize sequence
- **Messaging Dojo**: Advanced communication training with complex message patterns
- **State Management Lab**: High-tech facility for tracking complex state transitions

*Memory hook: The advanced equipment reminds you that EnhancedBaseAgent extends BaseAgent with lifecycle methods, advanced messaging, and sophisticated state management in `src/agents/enhanced_base_agent.py`.*

## Orchestrator's Office

Across from the training center is an impressive office complex with a commanding view of the entire wing.

### Command and Control Center

The central room has a large holographic display showing the status of all document processing activities. The Orchestrator (represented by a distinguished figure with a master key) coordinates all operations from here.

*Memory hook: The holographic display reminds you that OrchestratorAgent in `src/agents/orchestrator.py` has a complete view of all processing activities.*

### Workflow Planning Room

Adjacent to the command center is a room with elaborate planning tables and flowchart boards. Here, workflow sequences are designed and optimized.

*Memory hook: The planning tables remind you that WorkflowOrchestrator in `src/agents/workflow_orchestrator.py` designs and manages workflow sequences.*

### Agent Dispatch Station

A busy room with communication terminals where specialized agents receive their assignments and report their progress.

*Memory hook: The dispatch terminals remind you that the orchestrator delegates tasks to specialized agents.*

## Specialist Wing

The final section contains offices for specialized agents, each designed to reflect their function.

### Parser Agent Office

A room filled with document scanners, magnifying glasses, and text analysis tools. The agents here wear special glasses that allow them to "see into" documents.

*Memory hook: The analysis tools remind you that ParserAgent in `src/agents/parser_agent.py` extracts structured content from documents.*

### Metadata Agent Office

A highly organized room with card catalogs, indexes, and classification systems. Agents here are meticulously categorizing and tagging information.

*Memory hook: The cataloging systems remind you that MetadataAgent in `src/agents/metadata_agent.py` extracts and organizes document metadata.*

### Validator Agent Office

A quality control lab with testing equipment, verification protocols, and accuracy measurement tools. Agents here carefully examine documents for errors.

*Memory hook: The testing equipment reminds you that ValidatorAgent in `src/agents/validator_agent.py` verifies document accuracy and completeness.*

### Code Building Department

A large engineering department with blueprint tables, coding stations, and collaborative spaces. Multiple specialized agents work together on complex code creation.

*Memory hook: The engineering environment reminds you of the code building system in `src/agents/code_building_workflow.py` with its multiple specialized agents.*

## How to Use This Memory Palace Room

When recalling the agent system:

1. **Enter the main hall** - Remember the base agent foundation
2. **Visit the training centers** - Recall the progression from basic to enhanced agents
3. **Stop by the orchestrator's office** - Visualize the coordination process
4. **Tour the specialist offices** - Remember the specialized agent types

Each location contains visual hooks that remind you of specific code files and their functions within the agent system.
