# User Experience

This directory contains the user experience documentation for the Super Simple Code Framework Visualizer system.

## Files

- [User Journey Maps](./visualization_system_user_journey.md) - Detailed journey maps for different user personas

## User Personas

The user experience is designed for four key personas:

1. **Technical Manager** - Needs high-level understanding for strategic decisions
2. **Junior Developer** - New team member learning the codebase
3. **Non-Technical Stakeholder** - Business user needing functional understanding
4. **Educator** - Teaching programming concepts

## User Journeys

Each persona follows a different journey through the system:

- **Technical Manager Journey** - Architecture review and strategic planning
- **Junior Developer Journey** - Learning and contributing to codebase
- **Non-Technical Journey** - Understanding functionality without technical detail
- **Educator Journey** - Creating teaching materials

## Key Interaction Touchpoints

The user experience is shaped by five key touchpoints:

1. **Codebase Input Interface** - How users provide code for visualization
2. **Initial Visualization View** - First interaction with the visualization
3. **Interactive Exploration Controls** - Tools for exploring the visualization
4. **Narrative Display** - How explanatory content is presented
5. **Export and Sharing Interface** - How visualizations are shared

## Experience Optimization Opportunities

The documentation identifies several experience enhancement opportunities:

1. **Personalization** - User preferences and saved views
2. **Progressive Learning Path** - Guided tours and incremental complexity
3. **Collaborative Features** - Shared annotations and discussions
4. **Feedback Integration** - User ratings and improvement suggestions
